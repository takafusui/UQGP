# UQGP: Uncertainty Quantification based on Gaussian Process

## Getting Started
This project involes two sub-modules:

- `GP` folder containts Gaussian Process related utilities based on `PyTorch`,
`GPyTorch` and `BoTroch`.
- `UQ` folder containts Uncertainty Quantification related functions to compute
the Sobol indices, the Shapley values and the univariate effects.

## Prerequisites
In this project, you depend on `Tensorflow`, `PyTorch`, `GPyTorch` and `BoTorch`.
I highly recommend to prepare a `virtualenv` and to install necessary packages
within this environment.
